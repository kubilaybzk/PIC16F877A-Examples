Start PICSimLab. Select the board McLab2. Select PIC16F877A as
microcontroller using the micro-controller tab. Configure the microcontroller through your
code as follows:
#pragma config FOSC = XT // Oscillator Selection bits (XT oscillator)
#pragma config WDTE = OFF // Watchdog Timer Enable bit (WDT disabled)
#pragma config PWRTE = OFF // Power-up Timer Enable bit (PWRT disabled)
#pragma config BOREN = OFF // Brown-out Reset Enable bit (BOR disabled)
#pragma config LVP = OFF // Low-Voltage (Single-Supply) In-Circuit Serial
Programming Enable bit (RB3 is digital I/O, HV on MCLR must be used for
programming)
#pragma config CPD = OFF // Data EEPROM Memory Code Protection bit (Data
EEPROM code protection off)
#pragma config WRT = OFF // Flash Program Memory Write Enable bits (Write
protection off; all program memory may be written to by EECON control)
#pragma config CP = OFF // Flash Program Memory Code Protection bit (Code
protection off)
Program the microcontroller so that one-digit decimal number on the right-most display is
- incremented every 0.2 second if S3 is continuously pressed.
- decremented every 0.2 second if S4 is continuously pressed.
- not changed if none of the switches is pressed as shown in Solution_Video_2.
The number shown on the display will be 0(zero) when 9 is incremented. Similarly, the
number shown will be 9 when 0(zero) is decremented as shown in Solution_Video_2.
